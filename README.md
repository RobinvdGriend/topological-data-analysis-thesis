# Bachelor's Thesis on Topological Data Analysis

## Abstract
Topological data analysis is a novel field of mathematics in which
topology is applied to problems in data analysis. In this paper we will
study a particular tool from topological data analysis called *peristent
homology*.

First, we develop the theory of simplicial complexes and their
topological counterparts polyhedra. We then define a particular type of
homology theory called *simplicial homology* which, intuitively,
captures *n*-dimensional ‘holes’ of polyhedra.

As a motivating example for the definition of persistence homology, we
will consider the Čech complex of a point cloud *X* ⊆ ℝ<sup>*N*</sup>.
The Čech complex is constructed as a *parametrized* simplicial complex,
that for each choice of a parameter gives a simplicial homology.

By looking at how this simplicial homology changes as we go from one
choice of the parameter to another, we then define the *persistence
homology* of a filtration. The persistence diagram of a filtration turns
out to particularly useful representation of persistence homology.
Furthermore the space of all persistence diagrams admits a metric called
the *bottleneck distance* by which we can compare the persistence
diagrams of different filtrations.

Lastly, we show an important result called The Bottleneck Stability
which ensures that the bottleneck distance is stable with respect to
small perturbations of the filtration.
